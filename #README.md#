XFG# Summary

This is a simple command line utility that randomly interleaves the files in multiple directory sub-trees. It takes an arbitrary number of directories, finds their files, interleaves the files from its arguments randomly and puts the list on std out.

The intended use of this was to aid in the binge watching of multiple tv shows at the same time.
